At the end of March, Jude and I bumped into Vincent and Eugene from [intruders.tv](http://uk.intruders.tv) at [Minibar London](http://internetpro.meetup.com/10/) where I mentioned that it was a shame we couldn't really get to any of the cool web conferences going on in Europe, at which point Vincent mentioned they were looking for someone to do some interviews at [The Next Web 2008](http://2008.thenextweb.org/) conference in Amsterdam the following week. Go to Amsterdam, the party capital of Europe, and interview some of the hottest people in the tech world. Hell yes.

So following in the footsteps of [Immad](http://www.immadsnewworld.com/2007/11/me-on-intruderstv.html), we grabbed the camera, flew over to Amsterdam and tried to interview the best people we could find. Who knew it would be so easy!

The first major interview we got was with Kevin Rose of [digg.com](http://digg.com) fame and talked to many more people throughout both days, it seems that if you have a camera and you ask politely for an interview, people are more than happy to oblige.

It was great fun, an awesome way to meet people and make great friends and contacts.

So check out intruders.tv if you haven't been there before, and especially check out the interviews we did :)
