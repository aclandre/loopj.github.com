title: 5 Must Have Wordpress Plugins
---

I manage a number of wordpress blogs such as this one, and wordpress plugins can really improve the experience. Here are my five favourite wordpress plugins that I can't live without!

Comments (DISQUS)
--------------------
Wordpress' built in commenting sucks. The DISQUS comment system replaces your WordPress comment system with your comments hosted and powered by DISQUS. You get user authentication, ranking, spam filtering, pingbacks and much much more when you install disqus. This is the first thing I install on any wordpress blog.

Twitter (Tweetable)
-------------------
This plugin fully integrates Twitter with your WordPress blog. As well as automatically tweeting new blog posts, it also display your latest tweets in your sidebar and shows a tweetmeme counter on your blog posts. The perfect all-in-one solution for twitter + wordpress!

FeedBurner (Flagrant Diregard)
------------------------------
This plugin detects all ways to access your original WordPress feeds and redirects them to your FeedBurner feed so you can track every possible subscriber.

Syntax Highlighting (WP-Syntax)
-------------------------------
If you have a blog where you often post code samples in your articles, it helps to have syntax highlighting for these sections. This plugin supports tons of languages and uses GeSHi for the parsing so it is well supported.

SEO (All in One SEO Pack)
-------------------------
Out-of-the-box SEO for your Wordpress blog. Adds meta keywords and descriptions, optimises your page titles and urls, and stops duplicate urls being created.
